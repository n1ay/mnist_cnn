## What is this ##
It is a mnist dataset model built with Keras   
Check Keras: http://keras.io/

## Performance ##
Currently it reaches 98% accuracy within 10 epochs.

## Improvement capabilities ##
* data augumentation
* data normalization
* model rearragement (simplification?)
* using more specific optimizer with fixed parameters
